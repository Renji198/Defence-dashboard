Power BI Dashboard: Financial & Strategic Insights into India’s Defence Sector (2019–2024)
Project Overview

India’s defence sector is rapidly evolving with both government and private players contributing to production, exports, and innovation. To better understand industry trends, I designed and developed a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive 360° analysis of seven major defence companies:

HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd)

BEL (Bharat Electronics Ltd)

BDL (Bharat Dynamics Ltd)

Cochin Shipyard

Solar Industries

Paras Defence & Space Technologies

Sika Interplant Systems

The dashboard covers financial stability, profitability & valuation, and cash-flow analysis, enabling quick comparisons and insights for stakeholders, analysts, and decision-makers.

 Data & Technology Stack

 Data Source: SharePoint repositories (financial + operational data).
 ETL & Storage: Connected via SharePoint connectors, structured & modeled within Power BI.
 Transformations: Power Query for data cleaning & shaping.
 Modeling & Analytics: Extensive use of DAX functions, field parameters, and dynamic calculations.
 User Experience: Interactive navigation built using bookmarks, slicers, and custom page navigation.

This ensured the dashboard is not just a reporting tool, but a decision-support platform.
