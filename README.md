Power BI Dashboard: Financial & Strategic Insights into India’s Defence Sector (2019–2024)
1. Project Overview

India’s defence sector is rapidly evolving with both government and private players contributing to production, exports, and innovation. To better understand industry trends, I designed and developed a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive 360° analysis of seven major defence companies:

HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd)

BEL (Bharat Electronics Ltd)

BDL (Bharat Dynamics Ltd)

Cochin Shipyard

Solar Industries

Paras Defence & Space Technologies

Sika Interplant Systems

The dashboard covers financial stability, profitability & valuation, and cash-flow analysis, enabling quick comparisons and insights for stakeholders, analysts, and decision-makers.

2. Data & Technology Stack

📌 Data Source: SharePoint repositories (financial + operational data).
📌 ETL & Storage: Connected via SharePoint connectors, structured & modeled within Power BI.
📌 Transformations: Power Query for data cleaning & shaping.
📌 Modeling & Analytics: Extensive use of DAX functions, field parameters, and dynamic calculations.
📌 User Experience: Interactive navigation built using bookmarks, slicers, and custom page navigation.

This ensured the dashboard is not just a reporting tool, but a decision-support platform.

3. Key Insights from the Dashboard
📊 Financial Stability

BEL, HAL, and Cochin Shipyard emerged as the most stable players based on weighted capital efficiency and Z-Score.

Dividend payouts and EPS trends highlight consistent shareholder returns by HAL and BEL.

📊 Profitability & Valuation

Solar Industries recorded the highest P/E ratio, reflecting strong investor confidence.

EPS CAGR (2019–24) shows HAL and BEL as leaders in earnings growth.

ROCE and ROA trends suggest HAL is outperforming peers in capital efficiency.

📊 Cash-Flow & Production Trends

HAL and BEL dominate in operating cash flows, while private sector firms like Solar show strong growth momentum.

Production CAGR highlights shifts between government-led and private sector defence output.

Export contracts (2020–24) increased significantly, indicating India’s growing global defence footprint.

4. Why This Dashboard Stands Out

✔️ Interactive Drill-Downs: Company-wise and year-wise analysis with dynamic filtering.
✔️ Visual Storytelling: KPIs such as ROE, EPS, Debt-to-Equity, Market Share displayed clearly.
✔️ Comparative View: Easy benchmarking between government vs private sector performance.
✔️ Scalability: Built on SharePoint + Power BI, making it extensible for future datasets.

5. Outcome & Impact

The dashboard provides:

Analysts → A structured way to evaluate defence stocks.

Decision-makers → Insights into financial health and growth opportunities.

Industry professionals → Clear trends across 2019–2024, supporting strategic planning.

This project demonstrates the power of data storytelling with Power BI—turning raw financials into actionable intelligence.
